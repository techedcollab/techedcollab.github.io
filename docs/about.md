The **Technology Education Collaborative** fosters a robust Arizona tech community. We do this by providing virtual and 
in-person spaces to meet, learn, collaborate and advocate. Our articles, newsletters and events inform and educate both 
professional and aspiring technologists. We’re bringing Arizona technologists together to support the safe, secure 
future they work to create each and every day.

- TEC believes in conversation, collaboration and people learning from each other. That’s why **we offer local tech 
meetups a free Discord channel** on [our server](https://discord.gg/EDfSeTT2Jb). **We’ll handle the setup, you bring the community.** Even if you’re 
brand new to Discord, we can help you leverage this awesome platform to streamline meeting planning and keep the great
conversation going. If you run a tech meetup and are **tired of scrambling to find a venue**, we offer members 
introductions to **three fully-equipped venues** to get together and talk tech.

- Our **[articles and newsletters](/blog.html)** explore everything from cutting edge tech and social tech trends to 
cybersecurity and the policy and laws that can shape what tech you can use and how. We’ll never tell you what to think
about tech policy, but we will teach you how to share your opinions with the decision makers who matter most.

- Our **meetups, webinars and events** support and educate established technologists and introduce newcomers to 
the tech community. We’ve done everything from support cybersecurity and privacy meetups to demo 3D printers for 
underserved communities that otherwise wouldn’t have a lot of opportunity to see that tech in action.

Whether you’re a **retired tech professional who remembers phreaking** or someone simply **curious if getting into tech 
might be for you**, TEC connects you with relevant, useful information and a supportive community.
