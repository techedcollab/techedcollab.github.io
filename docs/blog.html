<h2>TEC Blog on Substack</h2>
This publication will examine issues in tech and society in a way that (hopefully) leads to more secure and mindful use of technology. We welcome guest writers who include local technologists actively working the field, people who shape tech policy and other thought leaders in the tech space.

<h2>TEC Newsletters</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>AZ Tech Law & Policy</b> will break from the traditional business-centered approach of covering tech and focus more on the tech news that directly impacts all Arizonans. That's not say we won't cover tech biz, just that it won't be our main focus.</li>
    <li><b>Good News in Tech</b> will offer a reprieve from the valid concerns about tech's potential negative impacts on society (which will be covered in our blog). This newsletter serves to remind us of why tech is awesome and how it truly elevates humanity. Subscribe to this newsletter if you want updates on all the cool, awesome, straight-from-sci-fi tech that's being developed and deployed in real life. </li>
