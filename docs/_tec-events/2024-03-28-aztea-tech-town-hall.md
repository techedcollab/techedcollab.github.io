# Right to Repair Workshop

- March 28th, 12pm
- Advanced Cyber Systems Lab at Gateway Community College

## Summary

💻 We're so excited to co-host the AzTEA (ISTE/COSN Arizona) & Arizona Department of Education Tech Town Hall tomorrow at GateWay Community College. 👩‍🏫

👉 Attend in-person or virtually by registering here: [https://myemail.constantcontact.com/AzTEA---ADE-Town-Hall-March-28th.html?soid=1109843077357&aid=VcRnxj_mHbA](https://myemail.constantcontact.com/AzTEA---ADE-Town-Hall-March-28th.html?soid=1109843077357&aid=VcRnxj_mHbA)

TEC's got a cool hands-on activity planned for in-person attendees and will give a tour of the Advanced Cyber Systems lab. Spoiler alert: The ACSL has a podcasting studio, small biz firewall and is the ONLY Right-to-Repair hub in the Phoenix Valley. (Not gonna lie, we kinda love that's it's TEC's home base. 😊 )

🍕 Oh, and in keeping with our brand, we're bringing the pizza.
