## Presentation 1: What the FISA?! Privacy Under the Fighting – and Flailing – Fourth Amendment

Next month, Congress needs to renew Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1972 (FISA).

During this high-level talk, Christina Eichelkraut will give a basic overview of Constitutional privacy protections, how Section 702 may undermine those protections and examine why the reauthorization of Section 702 is no longer guaranteed a rubber stamp approval from Congress.

Section 702, itself part of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, enables federal officials to conduct surveillance on anyone outside of the U.S. in the interest of national security.

The problem is the law was written in a way that has enabled egregious abuses, including the mass surveillance of Americans on U.S. soil, the vast majority of whom have nothing to do with terrorist plots or nefarious acts.

The FBI and the Biden Administration says Section 702 essential for protecting national security. But legal scholars, government watchdog groups and internet privacy advocates say Section 702 has been widely abused and does little, if anything, to protect Americans from threats.

## Presentation 2: Breakdown in Communication

Breakdown in Communication: Modern Communication…and why we don’t have it.

Elio Grieco will discuss the state of modern, digital communications, popular and obsucre messaging programs, and what’s missing from all of them.

What are the basic building blocks of a truly modern communication system? Identity, data sync, and data curation and discovery.

We’ll take a look at past, current, and upcoming digital communication programs like IRC, Signal, SimpleX and others. What are their features, and what features are missing? What trends do we see in feature set, and how has feature set influenced modern communications and general human cognition?

What are the pressures leading us into such app designs? What are the threats to communication? Well talk about the Crypto Wars and the 4 Horesmen of the Infocalypse, including the current threats coming out of Europe and the US.

We’ll end with a list of organizations that are championing important communication research, giving everyone the info they need to follow these trends and get involved in correcting them
