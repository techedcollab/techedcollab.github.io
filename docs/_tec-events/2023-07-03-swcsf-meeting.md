## Presentation Topic: You Can Be Correct Sir

![iFacts slide from the Making Software Correct by Construction talk](/assets/images/events/2023-07-03-swcsf.png)

A watch-along review of [Making Software ‘Correct by Construction’ by Professor Martyn Thomas CBE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03mUs5NlT6U). We’ll watch this talk together and pause for any questions you might have during the talk.

In the video, professor Martyn Thomas covers techniques to **build software with few to no bugs in less time** than it takes build today’s broken and insecure systems. He also covers case studies of cost and time to market for such software, putting to rest the mistaken belief that it “costs too much and takes too long” to build software properly. While some of the techniques are advanced, **most of the principles discussed can be successfully applied in any software development team or project today**.

And not a moment too soon as [the cost of poor software quality in the US has grown to at least $2.41 trillion, while the accumulated software Technical Debt (TD) has grown to ~$1.52 trillion as of 2022](https://www.it-cisq.org/the-cost-of-poor-quality-software-in-the-us-a-2022-report/). The public is becoming weary of the constant parade of patches that never seem to make our software any less buggy nor slow the ever increasing frequency and scale of cyber attacks.

Luckily, [CISA’s Secure by Design, Secure by Default](https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign) initiative is a push in the right direction. It likely won’t be long before insurance companies and regulators start to follow their lead and demand the reliability, security, and accountability that is the mark of any mature engineering discipline.

**It’s time to move deliberately and fix things.**
