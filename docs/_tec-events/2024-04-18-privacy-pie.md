Talk: EULA Never Believe What You've Agreed To! 

We all click "I Agree" without knowing what we’ve agreed to. Those blocks of text no one reads are called End User License Agreements or EULAs (pronounced You-Lah). 

This month we'll learn what, exactly, we're "agreeing" to, why this system exists, who it does and doesn't benefit, and how you can take back some agency within this system (spoiler alert: you don't, in fact, always have to agree). 

We’ll have some laughs over the worst and most hilarious EULA agreements ever, too. 

Last Slice of Privacy PIE: This 20-minute section at the end of the meeting will show you some no-code tools that help you understand what EULAS say.
