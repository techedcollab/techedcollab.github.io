# Balsz 3D Printing Demo

- December 12, 2023
- Balsz Online Academy

## Summary

We had a blast introducing the students of the Balsz Online Academy, a virtual K-8 school in the Balsz Elementary School District, to 3D printing!

👩‍💻 Each group, divided by grade bands, designed different parts of a truck using [Tinkercad Education](https://www.tinkercad.com/classrooms-resources)'s in browser software.

Meanwhile, a Christmas ornament was printed during the presentation so the students could witness the printer in action. Every student also received a 3D printed fidget spinner printed in the school district's colors.
