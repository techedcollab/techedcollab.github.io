# Privacy PIE: Smart Cities: What They Know About You

- July 23rd, 6 p.m.
- Advanced Cyber Systems Lab at Gateway Community College

## Summary

Talk: Smart Cities: What They Know About You

This month [Christina Eichelkraut](https://www.techedcollab.org/people/christina_eichelkraut.html) - an unabashed, car free urbanist -- will discuss **[smart cities](https://www.twi-global.com/technical-knowledge/faqs/what-is-a-smart-city) and their implications for personal privacy.**

Much of this technology is incredible, necessary and will certainly elevate and enhance urban life.

But there are still **privacy and civil rights implications that often go ignored** by nontechnical decision makers who are (understandably) bedazzled by this specific kind of technology's potential.

[Phoenix](https://law.asu.edu/centers/law-science-innovation/smart-cities-and-regions) and Portland are the epicenters of the national smart city movement and receiving a lot of federal funding for implementation, so this discussion is of particular importance to local residents within the Phoenix metro Valley.

**Last Slice of Privacy PIE:** This 20-minute section at the end of the meeting will show you **easy ways to protect your privacy when out in public..**
