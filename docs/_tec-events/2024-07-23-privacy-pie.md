# Privacy PIE: Smart Cities: What They Know About You

- July 23rd, 6 p.m.
- Advanced Cyber Systems Lab at Gateway Community College

## Summary

This month Christina Eichelkraut – an unabashed, car free urbanist -- will discuss smart cities and their implications for personal privacy. 

Much of this technology is incredible, necessary and will certainly elevate and enhance urban life. But there are still privacy and civil rights implications that often go ignored by nontechnical decision makers who are (understandably) bedazzled by this specific kind of technology’s potential. Phoenix and Portland are the epicenters of the national smart city movement and receiving a lot of federal funding for implementation, so this discussion is of particular importance to local residents within the Phoenix metro Valley. 

This event is free and open to the general public. 

Last Slice of Privacy PIE: This 20-minute section at the end of the meeting will show you some no-code tools that help you understand what EULAS say.
