# Right to Repair Workshop

- March 19th, 7pm
- Advanced Cyber Systems Lab at Gateway Community College

## Summary

TEC is excited to announce our Right to Repair Workshop on Tuesday, March 19th from 7-8 p.m.  Note: We are NOT going to fix your device for you.  

 We provide the tools and expert instruction you need to REPAIR YOUR TECH YOURSELF, which is both the point of the event and part of the fun.

 Bring your broken phone or tablet and replacement parts to the Advanced Cyber Systems Lab at GateWay Community College. If you need help finding the necessary parts, email contact@techedcollab.org and we'll point you in the right direction. Or, bring the device anyway and we'll get you sorted during the workshop. 

 After a brief introduction to the Right to Repair movement, Mustafa Ungyer, from MicroFix, will offer expert guidance on fixing your device. 

  He'll help you find the right manuals and credible online information so you can save your own tech.

   Thanks to iFixit, the ACSL has all the specialty tools you'll need, from technical screwdrivers to antistatic tables.

  Our mission is to promote the secure, thoughtful use of technology. That means teaching folks that old devices do NOT have to end up in a landfill and you don't need to be a techie to save some money. 

  The ACSL (also known locally as "The Lab") is on Gateway Community Collegeâ€™s Washington Campus at 108 N. 40th St. in Phoenix, AZ. It is the first room at the top of the stairs in the Main Building -- the wall is bright orange and you can't miss it!

 MicroFix is a locally owned cell phone repair shop in Tempe, Arizona. They've been fixing phones, tablets, and PCs since 2016, addressing a wide variety of technical problems. If they can't fix it, they don't charge for it. You couldn't ask for a more knowledgeable, ethical guide than Mustafa for your right-to-repair journey.
