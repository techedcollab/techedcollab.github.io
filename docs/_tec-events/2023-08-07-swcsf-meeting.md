## Topic 1: Pegasus & the Phantom Menace It Left Behind

The U.S. Government [recently banned](https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-restricts-use-of-commercial-hacking-tools-by-u-s-agencies-f0a4afda) the use of [Pegasus](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-pegasus-how-surveillance-spyware-invades-phones/), surveillance software developed by the Israeli firm NSO. The decision came on the heels of the discovery that 50 U.S. Government officials were surveilled by the no-click spyware.

However, the global cybersurveillance industry continues to thrive, often being used to attack journalists, lawyers, human rights advocates and dissidents of autocratic regimes. Yet it is also used to effectively break up child trafficking rings, capture drug lords and prevent large-scale terrorist attacks.

This conversation will discuss what Pegasus is, where it came from and how it influences major geopolitical outcomes. We’ll briefly touch on what is at stake in a world where private privacy interests increasingly conflict with the modern methods used for legitimate intelligence gathering efforts. And, we’ll examine how the blurring the lines between the private and public sectors particularly lends itself to abuse. Finally, we’ll cover what is being done by the U.S. and other countries.

## Topic 2: Android Privacy Tips

While the fight against military grade spyware is long and slow, there are some relatively simple steps that can be taken to improve your privacy and harden your Android phone against more modest threats.

Why aren’t we covering Apple? Well, Apple does not allow modification of their devices via either hardware or software. If you have an Apple device, you are limited to the hardening and security mitigations that they have provided.

We’ll cover what you can protect and the limits of said protection for:
- network traffic
- location data
- eavesdropping (visual and auditory)
- Android permissions
- permissions that are more dangerous than they seem e.g. the accelerometer
- a few side channels

As well as more permanent solutions:
- physical blocking
- privacy front-ends
- chaffing (data pools)
- open source hardware and software to prevent or slow enshittification
- legislative solutions and their limits
