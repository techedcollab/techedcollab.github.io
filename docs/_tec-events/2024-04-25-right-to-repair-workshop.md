ü§≥ Bring your own broken phone or tablet OR use one of our busted devices to learn on risk free! After a 10-minute introduction to the Right to Repair movement, you‚Äôll have time (and guidance) to fix a techno-widget. 

üîß We have all the specialty tools you'll need thanks to iFixit! That includes everything from  technical screwdrivers to antistatic tables. 


‚ùó Note: We are NOT going to fix your device for you. The point of this event is to empower you to learn to REPAIR TECH YOURSELF. ‚ùó 

üí° Mustafa Ungyer, from MicroFix, will offer expert guidance on fixing the device. He'll help you find the right manuals, credible online videos and demonstrate using the tools and equipment. In addition to being an experienced repair technician, Mustafa has nearly 20 years of teaching experience. 

üåç Save the planet! And money! üí≤ Your old tech does NOT have to end up in a landfill and you don't need to be a techie to save some money. 

‚≠ê MicroFix is a locally owned cell phone repair shop in Tempe, Arizona. They've been fixing phones, tablets, and PCs since 2016, addressing a wide variety of technical problems. If they can't fix it, they don't charge for it. You couldn't ask for a more knowledgeable, ethical guide than Mustafa for your right-to-repair journey.
