💡 Wyatt Johnson is the CNT/CIS Program Director at Gateway Community College in Phoenix, AZ and teaches mainly Networking and Cybersecurity classes. He has a Masters in Curriculum and Instruction from ASU, a decent sized stack of certifications and years of IT experience. He firmly believes that Star Wars > Star Trek and that Tom Baker was the best Doctor. One of his most disappointing moments was finding out that there was no way to make watching Monty Python and the Search for the Holy Grail a prerequisite for any class.

Note: Mustafa is taking the summer off, but he’ll be back in September!
