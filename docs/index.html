<b>The Technology Education Collaborative supports the secure, thoughtful use of technology.</b>
<p>
    Our efforts help people better understand the computers embedded in everyday life so people are empowered to make intentional decisions about the tech they use.
</p>
<p>
    Through articles written by experienced technologists and credible sources, we explore topics ranging from cybersecurity to cutting-edge tech advancements. We keep people impacted by tech policy – which is basically everyone – informed by sharing actionable
    information about current legislation and policy work in the tech space.
</p>
<p>
    By providing both physical and virtual spaces for technology meetups and events, <strong>we support and foster the Arizona tech community</strong> with accessible ways to promote thoughtful, robust discussion and collaboration.
