We support a select number of local tech meetups by **providing a meeting venue** if needed and other organizational support. We also **give local tech meetups  a Discord channel on our [TEC server](https://discord.gg/EDfSeTT2Jb)**. This provides a virtual place to share documents, plan the next meetup and keep the conversation going. **[Contact us](/contact.html) to learn more.**
