Andrew has enjoyed being a part of creating the Gateway Advanced Cyber Security
Lab, a space where students and experienced technologists come together the 
explore the expanding boundaries of emerging technology and their own growing 
skills. As a board member of TEC, Andrew hopes to help others gain a more robust 
understanding of the powers and perils of technology while working on his 
personal quest to develop less buggy code. In his free time, Andrew is printing 
an ever-expanding gridfinity system for his impressive home maker space. That 
will keep him busy for at least a little while.
