Wyatt Johnson is the CNT/CIS Program Director at Gateway Community College in 
Phoenix, AZ and teaches mainly Networking and Cybersecurity classes. He has a 
Masters in Curriculum and Instruction from ASU, a decent sized stack of 
certifications and years of IT experience. He firmly believes that Star Wars > Star Trek
 and that Tom Baker was the best Doctor. One of his most disappointing
moments was finding out that there was no way to make watching Monty Python 
and the Search for the Holy Grail a prerequisite for any class.
