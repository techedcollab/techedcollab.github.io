GateWay Community College - Washington Campus 

108 N. 40th St. 
Phoenix, AZ 85034

The ACSL is located in Room 2108 of the MA building. Go through the sliding glass doors at the front of the MA building and up the stairs to your immediate left. The room is the first door on the right in the hallway. The wall is bright orange so you canâ€™t miss it. There is also a sign on the sliding door with a number you can call for someone to come down and lead the way.
